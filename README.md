# Combo-Breaker
A robot designed to open and output the combination of a Master Lock Combination Lock in just seconds. This project is inspired by Samy Kamkar's own motorized lock breaker robot and uses the same 3D printed parts, Motors, and other electornics. The circuit board and code that runs on the arduino was designed by myself, as well as some modifications to the 3D design.

## The Robot in Action

## Materials
1. 3D printed chassis to hold the lock and motors and a 3D printed grip to connect the stepper motor to the lock's dial. (Printed on school-provided 3D printer) 
2. Stepper Motor for precise dial control 
3. Optical rotary encoder for reading the position of the stepper motor 
4. Servo motor for lifting the shackle of the lock while finding sticking points and when opening the lock 
5. Stepper motor driver and heat sinks 
6. Arduino to hold all code for the motors 
7. 1 mAh LiPo battery to power all components 
8. Voltage regulators, capacitors, wires 
9. Breadboard for wiring all components together (custom circuit design)
